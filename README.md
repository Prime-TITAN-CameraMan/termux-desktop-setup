# Termux native VS Proot-distro <a name=choose-linux></a>

### [1. Termux Native](#termux-native)

Termux native refers to running Linux commands directly within the Termux app without any additional virtualization or containerization. It provides a lightweight and straightforward way to access Linux utilities on your Android device.

### [2. Proot-Distro](#proot-distributions)

Proot-Distro is a method that utilizes `proot` (PRoot is a user-space implementation of chroot, mount --bind, and binfmt_misc) to run a full Linux distribution inside a chroot environment. This approach allows you to install and use a wide range of Linux distributions without root access. However, it may have some limitations compared to native installations.

#### Summary

- **Termux Native:** Simple and lightweight, but with limited capabilities compared to full Linux distributions.
- **Proot-Distro:** Allows running full Linux distributions without root access, but may have some limitations.
